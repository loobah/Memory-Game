# MemoryGame
Udacity Javascript Game Development

Welcome to this Memory Game, my 1st ever JavaScript project!

## Instructions
The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

### How to open the game
To start the game, all you need to do is to click on a random card.
Be aware that the clock starts running instantly!

### How to play the game
You can open two cards at a time, trying to match them with the same figure.

Make sure you memorize the icons the best you can!
So you get to know where they are!

You can take as long as you want to complete the game,
but there are ways to measure your performance!

### How to achieve better scores
**Stars rating**
The stars rating are based on the number of moves you make while attempting to match all the cards.

**Time counter**
The time counter is another way to see how fast you can go.

**Number of moves**
Try to nail it as quick as possible!

You can restart the game at anytime, clicking at the restart icon, located at the top-right hand!

Hope you have a great time exercising your brain!!


## List of dependencies
This game was developed entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
